# AGENTS.md — shared/modules/model-registry/

## Purpose

Model sizes, immutable release-asset URLs, upstream checksum.txt, licenses, hosted flag. The canonical list of ASR models for both on-device and server use:
sizes, download URLs, **SHA-256 pins** (integrity gate, T1), and **per-model
license terms** (Security Review: runtime ASR models carry their own upstream terms,
outside the audit).

**Integrity policy (Security Review mitigation 1) [2]:** treat every `.onnx` as
untrusted. Model URLs are **pinned to immutable release-asset ids** (never the moving
asr-models ref), and every download is verified against the **checksum.txt the
upstream already publishes** — not just our own recorded SHA-256 [2].

**On-device (sherpa-onnx compatible, S25 Ultra 16 GB):**
- `small` — **recommended default** for real-time dictation
- `medium` — possible on 16 GB; higher accuracy, slower
- (tiny/base available for weaker hardware)

**Server (Whisper X container, CPU):** whatever the existing pipeline already
serves — document it here for parity.

**Format:** `models.yaml` — one entry per model: id, family (sherpa-onnx|whisper),
params, size_mb, url, sha256, **license** (the SPDX id when the license has one,
e.g. `MIT` for Whisper weights; check sherpa-onnx model cards), `license_name` and
`license_link` (required when the license has no SPDX id, such as a custom or
non-commercial model license), `upstream_commit` (the upstream source revision the
model file was built or converted from, recorded separately from `url`),
`tamper_verified` (true only after the tamper test has been run against this entry
and watched refusing a corrupted copy), hosted, notes. Required in every entry:
id, family, params, size_mb, url, sha256, upstream_commit, tamper_verified, hosted,
and either `license` or both `license_name` and `license_link`; only `notes` is
optional. The generated `licence` constant (ADR-016) carries the SPDX id, or
`license_name` when there is none. `models.yaml` is the hand-edited source of
record; it is not shipped to the phone and never parsed at runtime (ADR-016).

**Hosting (F30, D25):** if licensing permits, the model is also served from the
Breaker container (web-fe) with checksums, so the phone downloads from the
container instead of upstream [2]. Each entry records `hosted: true|false` and
the license check result (R26).

**Build phase:** Before Phase 2: `settings` (Phase 2) and `stt-ondevice` (Phase 3) both depend on it. Needs first: nothing beyond `shared`.

## Invariants
- Every entry has a sha256; download + verify path tested (tamper test).
- Every entry has a license field (R8).
- URLs pinned to specific releases (no floating "latest").
- Registry versioned; app refuses unknown model ids.
- **Every entry verifies against upstream's checksum.txt** (T21) [2].
- The generator checks every entry before it writes anything, and fails on a
  missing required field, an unknown field, a sha256 that is not 64 hex
  characters, a url that is neither a release-asset id URL
  (`.../releases/assets/<numeric id>`) nor a URL naming a full 40-character commit,
  or a license with neither an SPDX id nor a `license_name` and `license_link`.
  CI runs it, so a bad entry never reaches the app.

## Owns
Model sizes, immutable release-asset URLs, upstream checksum.txt, licenses, hosted flag.

## Public Interface
Generated Kotlin model registry (ADR-016)
- Kotlin constants generated from `models.yaml` by `tools/gen_model_registry.py`;
  consumers name a model by these constants, never by reading `models.yaml`.

## Depends On
- shared

## Does Not Own
- Download/verify logic (android/stt-ondevice)

## Test Locations
- Unit (Python): `tests/unit/shared/model-registry/`, created with the module's first code. Run: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests/unit/shared/model-registry`
- Structural contract: `tools/src/test/kotlin/dev/breaker/tools/RepoContractTest.kt`, run with every build (`./mvnw clean install`): card sections, README presence, reactor/registry agreement, no cycles.
- Every run must report more than 0 tests. A mistyped path or pattern runs nothing and still prints OK.

## Test Requirement
Every test added or touched for this module must be proven to fail loudly:
break the protected behavior on purpose, confirm the test fails and says why,
then restore the code. A test that only ever passes proves nothing. This
applies to every tier and invariant listed above, not only the ones that seem
fragile.

## How This Module Is Built
One engineer owns this module and delivers it as one pull request, working on
one module at a time. The owner does not write the module's code. The owner:
- splits the work into sub-modules and has sub-agents write each one, code and
  tests;
- coordinates and orchestrates those sub-agents, checks every piece of their
  work, and sends back anything that is wrong until it is right;
- convenes a small council of sub-agents to advise on design, risks and tests
  before and during the build;
- hands the finished, checked module directly to the reviewer as a single pull
  request.
The owner's own work is orchestration, checking and correction, not writing
code.

This is how the project's own team builds modules. It is recommended for AI
agents, not required: an outside contributor may write the code themselves
(`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Known Gotchas
- Not in the tree yet: `models.yaml`, `tools/gen_model_registry.py` and the CI step that runs its entry check are created when this module is built (ADR-016). Until then, this card describes them; nothing can import them.
- URLs pin to immutable release-asset ids; verify upstream checksum.txt [2].
- The generated Kotlin file is never hand-edited: edit `models.yaml`, rerun the
  generator, commit both. A contract test fails if they drift (ADR-016).
- Do not add a runtime YAML or JSON reader here or in a consumer (ADR-016).
- What we borrow from transcribe.cpp's model catalog (see "Related projects" in
  the root README): a hand-edited catalog, validated in CI, with everything else
  generated from it. Its catalog is one JSON file per model; ours is the single
  `models.yaml`. Do not copy its download path: it records no per-file checksum,
  and its download URLs follow a moving branch.
- The Maven boundary check does not require a consumer to declare a
  `<dependency>` on `shared/modules/model-registry` while this module has
  `<packaging>pom</packaging>` (publishes no artifact); the moment it gains
  code (`<packaging>jar</packaging>`) the edge becomes required, and
  `RepoContractTest.kt`'s boundary check will then demand it.
