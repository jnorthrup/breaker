# AGENTS.md — android/modules/phrases/

## Purpose

Voice phrases: 'Breaker Breaker' wake + 'And I'm Gone' send detection, reporting where the send phrase began. Hands-free voice control — two CB-slang phrases:
- **"Breaker Breaker"** (idle): wake — tile appears AND **recording starts
  automatically** (F4).
- **"And I'm Gone"** (recording): send — stop recording, **report where the
  phrase began** (`PhraseEvent.Send(trimBeforeMs)`) so `DictateUseCase.stopCapture`
  trims the capture there and the phrase never enters the transcription (F9),
  dispatch send (server-primary → format → commit/clipboard) (F5).

**Build phase:** Phase 10; it can be spiked alongside Phase 6. Needs first: `core` (on main); it gets audio through core's ports, so `audio` (Phase 2) should exist before it is finished.

## Owns
Voice phrases: 'Breaker Breaker' wake + 'And I'm Gone' send detection, reporting where the send phrase began.
Core (`DictateUseCase.stopCapture`) trims the capture at that point; this
module never touches the dictation audio.

## Public Interface
Implements `core.PhraseTrigger`: `start(onPhrase: (PhraseEvent) -> Unit)`,
`stop()`, `isListening`. `onPhrase` delivers a `PhraseEvent` — `Wake` (no data:
the capture starts after the wake phrase, so there is nothing to trim) or
`Send(trimBeforeMs: Long?)`, the milliseconds from the start of the active
capture to where the send phrase began. This module computes that offset; it
does not buffer or cut the dictation audio itself (see Audio handling).

**v1 mechanism — streaming on-device ASR + phrase matching:**
- The sherpa-onnx ASR (already in the base) runs in **streaming mode**; partial
  transcripts are matched against "breaker breaker" (idle) and "and i'm gone"
  (recording) with fuzzy/normalized matching (case, filler words).
- No training, no new dependency. Power is a non-issue (high-power mode, plugged in).

**Upgrade path — sherpa-onnx KWS (documented, not v1):**
- Dedicated keyword-spotting model (how "Hey Google" / "Alexa" work) for lower
  CPU/latency. Requires a small custom-trained model for our phrases; sherpa-onnx
  ships the KWS training toolkit (a few hundred clips per phrase).

**Audio handling:**
- This module never buffers or cuts the dictation audio. It runs its own
  streaming-ASR detection to find the phrases and, on the send phrase, works
  out `trimBeforeMs` — the offset from the start of the active capture to
  where the phrase began — reporting it as `PhraseEvent.Send(trimBeforeMs)`.
- `DictateUseCase.stopCapture(session, audioSource, trimBeforeMs)` is what
  keeps the audio before that offset and drops the phrase onward; a `null`
  offset keeps the whole capture. The dictation clip is core's, never this
  module's.

**State machine:** IDLE → (wake phrase) → RECORDING → (send phrase) → SENDING →
IDLE. Manual shake/tap can enter/exit the same states (shared with `gesture` +
`overlay`).

**Permissions (F11):** mic, sensor, overlay/foreground service, and notification
permissions are requested together at first startup.
**High-power mode (F12):** verify Android power-saving is off; prompt user to
enable high-performance mode if not.

## Invariants
- "Breaker Breaker" is reported as `PhraseEvent.Wake` reliably (tune the
  threshold on device); the app then starts recording (F4).
- "And I'm Gone" is reported as `PhraseEvent.Send` with `trimBeforeMs` at the
  phrase's onset, which is what lets core keep the phrase out of the
  transcription (F9).
- False positives < 1/day on device (N10).
- Manual shake/tap path unaffected (regression).
- Startup permission prompt grants all required permissions (F11).

## Depends On
- android
- android_core

## Does Not Own
- Gesture (gesture)
- Overlay (overlay)
- Training (training-client)

## Test Locations
- Unit (Kotlin): `android/modules/phrases/src/test/kotlin/`, created with the module's first code. Run: `./mvnw -pl android/modules/phrases test`
- Structural contract: `tools/src/test/kotlin/dev/breaker/tools/RepoContractTest.kt`, run with every build (`./mvnw clean install`): card sections, README presence, reactor/registry agreement, no cycles.
- Every run must report more than 0 tests. A mistyped path or pattern runs nothing and still prints OK.

## Test Requirement
Every test added or touched for this module must be proven to fail loudly:
break the protected behavior on purpose, confirm the test fails and says why,
then restore the code. A test that only ever passes proves nothing. This
applies to every tier and invariant listed above, not only the ones that seem
fragile.

## How This Module Is Built
One engineer owns this module and delivers it as one pull request, working on
one module at a time. The owner does not write the module's code. The owner:
- splits the work into sub-modules and has sub-agents write each one, code and
  tests;
- coordinates and orchestrates those sub-agents, checks every piece of their
  work, and sends back anything that is wrong until it is right;
- convenes a small council of sub-agents to advise on design, risks and tests
  before and during the build;
- hands the finished, checked module directly to the reviewer as a single pull
  request.
The owner's own work is orchestration, checking and correction, not writing
code.

This is how the project's own team builds modules. It is recommended for AI
agents, not required: an outside contributor may write the code themselves
(`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Known Gotchas
- This module must report where the send phrase began
  (`PhraseEvent.Send(trimBeforeMs)`) accurately; `DictateUseCase.stopCapture`
  is what actually trims the audio at that offset (F9).
- Audio arrives through `core.AudioSource`, wired by `android/app` (ADR-001); this module never imports `audio` or `stt-ondevice`. If keyword spotting needs a streaming-recognition port that core lacks, it is proposed as a core port when Phase 10 is built.
