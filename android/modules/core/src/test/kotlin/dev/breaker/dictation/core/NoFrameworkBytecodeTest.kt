/**
 * The framework-free rule, checked on the compiled bytecode rather than only on
 * the source text.
 *
 * `FrameworkFreeTest` reads the Kotlin sources, which is the right first gate but
 * can be fooled: a fully-qualified reference written without an import line, or a
 * reference smuggled in through a constant. This gate reads the constant pool of
 * every class the module actually shipped, so what it reports is what a real
 * adapter would link against at runtime.
 *
 * It is deliberately dependency-free: scanning a class file for the internal
 * package paths it names needs nothing but `readBytes()`, because a class file
 * stores every type it references as a UTF-8 constant. Taking a bytecode library
 * to check that the module has no libraries would defeat the point.
 *
 * The class files live under `build/classes/kotlin/main`, where the compile task
 * writes them. If that layout ever changes the test fails loudly rather than
 * passing vacuously.
 *
 * The list of forbidden packages is [ForbiddenFrameworks.packages], shared with the
 * source gate in `FrameworkFreeTest`, and `ForbiddenFrameworksTest` proves that both
 * gates flag every package on it.
