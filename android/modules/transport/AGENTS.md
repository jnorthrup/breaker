# AGENTS.md — android/modules/transport/

## Purpose

Whether the Local Server is reachable (TCP connect, 1.5 s timeout, and a 30 s cache that holds only a measured answer); it probes only the configured Local Server, so there is no cloud path to fall through to.
Core's `DictateUseCase` asks this probe and picks the engine itself
(**server-primary**); this module only answers the question and **never
contacts any other host** (Security Review fix #1).

**Build phase:** Phase 5, together with `stt-server`. Needs first: `core` (on main).

## Owns
Whether the Local Server is reachable (TCP connect, 1.5 s timeout, and a 30 s cache that holds only a measured answer); it probes only the configured Local Server, so there is no cloud path to fall through to.

## Public Interface
`TcpConnectivityProbe`, which implements `core.ConnectivityProbe`
(`isServerReachable(): Boolean`), the only port this module implements.
`android/app` constructs it as `TcpConnectivityProbe(serverUrlProvider, clock)`
and its DI wiring binds it into `core.DictateUseCase` (ADR-001), which makes the
routing decision itself from the probe's answer: which engine runs, the
`LOCAL_MODEL_MISSING` refusal, the server-primary fallback. This module never
imports `DictateUseCase` or a sibling module.

`TcpConnectivityProbe` also has `refresh(): Boolean`: probe now, ignoring the
30 s cache, and store the fresh answer (for example right after the user edits
the server address) - but only if that answer was measured, so a refresh that
finds no free slot or a still-parked lookup caches nothing. It is not on the
core port, so only the holder of the concrete probe (`android/app`) can call
it.

**Public types** — this list is the module's registry line, kept in the same
order and spelling:

- `TcpConnectivityProbe`

**How core uses the answer (`AppSettings.mode`, a `core.SttMode`):**
- `AUTO` (server-primary, the default): `DictateUseCase` asks this probe once,
  before the attempt. Reachable → the server engine, then the LLM formatter;
  not reachable → the on-device engine, then the rule-based formatter. A
  server failure after that is surfaced, not retried on the phone.
- `LOCAL`: always on-device, no probe. **No model installed → clear error
  (`LOCAL_MODEL_MISSING`), no server attempt, no misleading "Set API key."**
- `SERVER`: always the server, no probe; fails loudly if unreachable.

**Audio queue (ADR-002):** met by core, not by this module. `DictateUseCase`
records the whole clip before it asks the probe, so no audio waits on a probe
and none is dropped. This module holds no audio. Never block the UI.

## Invariants
- Reachable only when the configured Local Server accepts a TCP connect within
  1.5 s; refused, timed out or no network all answer "not reachable".
- A measured answer is cached for 30 s and can be refreshed on demand. Measured
  means the dial settled one way or another: a connection was accepted, or the
  connect produced a definite negative - refused, no network, a name that does
  not resolve, a body that threw, or a connect that ran out its own time, which
  normally settles inside the socket, just before the caller's budget runs out.
  NOT cached is only the probe that measured nothing: never dialled (no free
  slot, or this name's lookup still parked), or still running when the 1.5 s
  budget ran out - in practice a name whose lookup has not returned. A connect
  that timed out because its own socket timeout beat the caller's budget IS
  measured and cached; only when the caller's budget wins that race is the
  result not learned, and that is the case above.
- The probe never contacts any host other than the configured Local Server.
- Met and tested in core's `DictateUseCase`, listed so nobody rebuilds them
  here: server-primary picks the server when reachable and the phone when not
  (F1–F3); `LOCAL` with no model → `LOCAL_MODEL_MISSING` (fix #1 regression
  test); a probe never costs audio.

## Depends On
- android
- android_core

## Does Not Own
- The engines themselves (stt-*)
- Sync (sync)
- Routing between engines and the fallback decision (`core.DictateUseCase`)

## Test Locations
- Unit (Kotlin): `android/modules/transport/src/test/kotlin/`, created with the module's first code. Run: `./mvnw -pl android/modules/transport test`
- Structural contract: `tools/src/test/kotlin/dev/breaker/tools/RepoContractTest.kt`, run with every build (`./mvnw clean install`): card sections, README presence, reactor/registry agreement, no cycles.
- Every run must report more than 0 tests. A mistyped path or pattern runs nothing and still prints OK.

## Test Requirement
Every test added or touched for this module must be proven to fail loudly:
break the protected behavior on purpose, confirm the test fails and says why,
then restore the code. A test that only ever passes proves nothing. This
applies to every tier and invariant listed above, not only the ones that seem
fragile.

## How This Module Is Built
One engineer owns this module and delivers it as one pull request, working on
one module at a time. The owner does not write the module's code. The owner:
- splits the work into sub-modules and has sub-agents write each one, code and
  tests;
- coordinates and orchestrates those sub-agents, checks every piece of their
  work, and sends back anything that is wrong until it is right;
- convenes a small council of sub-agents to advise on design, risks and tests
  before and during the build;
- hands the finished, checked module directly to the reviewer as a single pull
  request.
The owner's own work is orchestration, checking and correction, not writing
code.

This is how the project's own team builds modules. It is recommended for AI
agents, not required: an outside contributor may write the code themselves
(`.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Known Gotchas
- Probe TTL-cached 30 s, but only a measured answer is — never block dictation on the server.
- **A wedged name lookup is bounded, not cured.** `InetAddress.getAllByName` has
  no timeout and ignores interrupts, so one hung DNS lookup (captive portal, VPN,
  firewall dropping DNS) can pin a worker. `ProbeExecutor` caps that at
  `MAX_WEDGED_PROBES` (2) and makes lookups for one name single-flight, so a
  permanently hung host holds at most ONE slot. The cap counts lookups THAT HAVE
  NOT ANSWERED YET, not lookups in flight generally: a worker hands its slot back
  the moment it PUBLISHES its answer, not when its task body returns, so a worker
  that has already answered must never keep the cap full - otherwise a healthy
  address is refused and answered "not reachable" with no dial, while nothing at
  all is wedged. **Post-answer work is not bounded:** a body that hangs AFTER
  answering still holds its thread, and at pool max further probes are refused as
  not measured until it ends. Today's post-answer work is socket close plus
  unmark - microseconds, but REASONED, not measured. Two limits also remain, both
  deliberate: **two DIFFERENT hung hosts still fill the cap** and every later
  probe is then refused; and a re-probe of a parked host answers "not reachable"
  at once, so a host that is merely slow is indistinguishable from a permanently
  wedged one for the duration of its lookup - the caller gets that answer with no
  evidence a dial was attempted. That is the price of not spending a second slot;
  the alternative is a cap overrun that silences healthy addresses too.
  **A refusal names its cause, and the two caps do not share one.** `claim()`
  hands back a sealed `Claim` - the admission it took, or the cap that stopped
  it - and names the two caps apart: `NO_FREE_SLOT` when every slot of
  `MAX_WEDGED_PROBES` is held by a lookup that has not answered, and
  `NO_FREE_THREAD` when all `POOL_MAX_THREADS` (3) threads are held by bodies
  that have not ended, which its reason text says out loud. Every refusal means
  the same thing to a CALLER - nothing was measured, nothing is cached - and a
  different thing in a report. The claim is taken under ONE lock, so a refused
  attempt writes nothing, mints no release token, and cannot release a slot it
  did not hold; the type is sealed, so a cap added later without a branch fails
  to compile rather than silently misreporting the cause.
- Speech engines: `core.SttEngine` instances are wired into
  `core.DictateUseCase` by `android/app` (ADR-001), not into this module. It
  never sees an `SttEngine` and never imports `stt-ondevice` or `stt-server`.
