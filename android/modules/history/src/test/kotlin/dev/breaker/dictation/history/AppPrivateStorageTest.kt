/**
 * T7: the database is app-private, and this module does not give it away.
 *
 * **What is proven here.** The two things this module actually controls: the
 * name the database is opened under, and the check that keeps that name inside
 * the app's own data directory. A history file that lands on shared storage is
 * every transcription the user has ever dictated, readable by every other app
 * on the device, and nothing in the app would show it.
 *
 * **What is not proven here, and cannot be.** Whether the file on a real device
 * ends up mode `0600` inside a `0700` directory is the platform's doing — the
 * framework creates it in the app's sandbox, and this module has no code that
 * changes its permissions. Only a device or an emulator can show the resulting
 * mode, so that check belongs to an instrumented test and is named as a gap in
 * the module's report rather than quietly claimed here.
 *
 * What *can* be proven on a plain JVM, and is: this module never asks for a
 * world-readable file, never names a path outside the private directory, and
 * never exports the database to another app.
