/*
 * The framework stays on one side of a line.
 *
 * Everything that describes a screen, holds the theme choice and writes a setting
 * is plain Kotlin, so the framework may be named in the package that turns a
 * described tree into views and in the single function the app calls. A reference
 * anywhere else is either a mistake or the first step of a dependency the module
 * was built not to have, and on the JVM it is also the first step of a class that
 * cannot be loaded without a device.
 *
 * The rule is read twice over: once in the module's text, where a fully qualified
 * name counts as much as an import, and once in the classes the build produces,
 * where a reference survives even if it is written in a way no import would
 * suggest.
