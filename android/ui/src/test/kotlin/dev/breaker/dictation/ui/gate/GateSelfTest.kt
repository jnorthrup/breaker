/*
 * What every gate reads, and the two checks that keep the set of gates itself
 * honest.
 *
 * The gates in this package are scans: they read files and compare them with
 * rules. A scan needs three things to be worth anything, and each of them is a
 * way for a scan to be quietly worthless. It needs files to look at, so an empty
 * result is a failure rather than a pass. It needs to find the module the same
 * way whatever directory the test was started in, so the answer does not depend
 * on the machine. And it needs a control, a piece of text the rule must catch,
 * which each gate file carries for its own rule.
 *
 * This file holds the first two, once, and checks that the gate list has not lost
 * a member: five rules, five files, each of them a test class of its own.
