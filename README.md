# Breaker

Open-source, privacy-first dictation system: a **phone app + self-hosted
server** that turns speech into Whisper Flow-style formatted text, with CB-slang
voice control ("Breaker Breaker" wakes, "And I'm Gone" sends).

**Voice is CB, look is trucking.** White/black/green, light + dark modes, CB mic
motif with a digital Cobra-style LED bar meter for state. The web FE and Android
app share one token set and look identical.

## How this repo is organized (read this first)

This repo follows a documented modular-architecture pattern — a Russian
nesting-doll model. Every level is documented the same complete way:

| Artifact | File | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| Master architecture | `ARCHITECTURE.md` | The whole system: modules, connections, rules. Longer than a typical summary on purpose — it is the single source of truth. Read once; use the map + cards day-to-day. |
| Module registry (machine-checkable) | root `pom.xml` reactor | One entry per module via `<modules>` (walked recursively), each with its own `<dependencies>`. `RepoContractTest.kt` validates the tree against it. |
| Root module map | `MODULE_MAP.md` | One line per module — find the right module without opening anything. |
| Module cards | `<module>/AGENTS.md` | The full card per module: Purpose, Owns, Does Not Own, Public Interface, Depends On, Invariants, Test Locations, Test Requirement, Known Gotchas, and How This Module Is Built (recommended, not required). |
| Module READMEs | `<module>/README.md` | Plain-language summary; a parent's README names its sub-modules. |
| Decision records | `decisions/ADR-NNN-<slug>.md` | Why we chose what we chose. Index, template and how to propose one: `decisions/README.md`. |
| Requirements / build order / security / UI | `docs/00`–`docs/07` | The numbered specs. |
| Glossary | `docs/08-glossary.md` | Plain-language definitions of the terms these docs use. |
| Consistency + repo gate | `tools/src/test/kotlin/dev/breaker/tools/{PomContractTest,RepoContractTest}.kt` | Fails if the tree drifts from the reactor, cards are missing sections, or cycles exist. Runs with every build: `./mvnw clean install`. |

## How agents work here

Read `AGENTS.md` (repo root) for the lane playbooks — Bug Hunt, Orchestration,
and Coding each have their lane, their entry points, and their definition of
done. The short version: **read the module's `AGENTS.md` before touching any
code, follow the terminology, and prove every test fails loudly** (see the Test
Requirement in every module card).

Setting up your own AI agents to contribute? Start with
[`agent-skills/README.md`](agent-skills/README.md). It holds the skills this
project's agents run, one pair per rank, and says which rank to give which agent.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrTrenchTrucker/breaker.git breaker && cd breaker
./mvnw -B -ntp clean install     # JDK 25 + Android SDK 36; see .github/CONTRIBUTING.md
```

## Security posture (Security Review, two audits)

- Base repo: clean bill of health with 4 fixes — no silent cloud fallthrough,
  in-app updater deleted, package ID changed, build-tool SHA-256 pinned — plus a
  NOTICE file (licensing) [1].
- sherpa-onnx: safe with three mitigations — pin models to immutable release-asset ids + verify upstream checksum.txt; track decoder bug #3983; keep sherpa-onnx
  off the server's network-exposed path [2].
- Honest caveat: the new modules compile and their tests run, but the forked
  base app is not on `main` yet and has not passed its build and smoke test —
  **Phase 0 is that gate** [1][2].

## Where things stand

Early. The build compiles and the tests of the built modules run, but the
forked base app is not on `main` yet (Phase 0), so nothing runs on a phone.
`docs/04-build-order.md` gives the order: a module can be built once the
modules it needs are. "In progress (maintainers)" means the project's own
team has claimed it, so please pick an Open one. Once the project is on
GitHub, its issue list is the live version of this table. The parent folders
`android/`, `server/` and `shared/` hold no feature code of their own and
aren't listed.
