# AGENTS.md — Repo-Level Instructions

This file tells any agent — at any level, in any later session — how to work in
this repo without being told by a person first.

## The three lanes

| Lane | Owner | Entry points |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Bug Hunt** | Security/QA | `docs/03-security-threat-model.md`, Phase 0 + Phase 9 gates, `tools/check_repo.py` |
| **Orchestration** | Structure/contracts | `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `pom.xml` (reactor), `MODULE_MAP.md`, `shared/modules/*`, `docs/04-build-order.md` |
| **Coding** | Implementation | The module's own `AGENTS.md` + `docs/01-requirements.md` (F-numbers) |

## The rules that always hold

1. **Read first.** Before drafting or changing anything, read the module's
   `AGENTS.md` and the module's entry in the root `pom.xml` reactor. New work must not
   silently contradict existing docs.
2. **Terminology:** we say *text commit* / *text insertion* — never
   "injection."
3. **No cross-module imports.** Modules talk through `core` ports or the app's
   dependency wiring in `android/app/`. Each module's `pom.xml` `<dependencies>` must stay
   acyclic — enforced by `RepoContractTest.kt`.
4. **Every module card carries its Test Requirement.** Anything built against a
   module must be proven to fail loudly: break the protected behavior on
   purpose, confirm the test fails and says why, then restore. A test that only
   ever passes proves nothing.
5. **Reactor and tree must agree.** Every module in the root `pom.xml` reactor has a real
   folder with `AGENTS.md` + `README.md`; every parent README names its
   sub-modules. `RepoContractTest.kt` checks this on every build (`./mvnw clean install`).
6. **Security gates are load-bearing.** The forked base app is not on `main`
   yet and has not passed its build and smoke test [1][2]. Modules may be
   built, reviewed and merged before the gates are signed off; the gates
   decide what reaches users. Nothing is released (no published APK or server
   image) until Phase 0 (build + smoke test) and Phase 9 (E2E + bench +
   security review) are signed off, and sync is not released until Phase 19
   (encryption by default). Gate status and evidence: `docs/04-build-order.md`,
   "Gates and releases".
7. **Models are untrusted.** Every `.onnx` is pinned to immutable release-asset ids and verified against upstream checksum.txt before use [2].
8. **No plaintext transcriptions in logs, ever** (F32). Events only, per-user.

## Definition of done (repo-wide)

- The root `pom.xml` reactor matches the folder tree; `RepoContractTest.kt` passes.
- Every touched module's card is accurate (Owns / Does Not Own / Public
  Interface / Depends On / Invariants / Test Locations / Test Requirement /
  Known Gotchas).
- Terminology clean; no cross-module imports outside `core` ports.
- Security Review's fixes [1] and the sherpa-onnx mitigations [2] are preserved.

## Build order

See `docs/04-build-order.md` — 22 phases, 0 (build gate) through 22 (UI/UX).

## 6. Standing orders

These hold in every module, every session, every lane.

- Build with `./mvnw` only. Never run a system `mvn`.
- Before you add or bump any version, run `sh tools/latest.sh` and paste its line. Do not write a version from memory. Your memory is a snapshot from before the newest release; the registry is not.
  - A library the script does not cover: `curl -s https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/<group path>/<artifact>/maven-metadata.xml` (AndroidX: `https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/<group path>/<artifact>/maven-metadata.xml`). Take the highest `<version>` with no `alpha`, `beta`, `rc`. Then add that library to `tools/latest.sh` in the same PR, so the next worker does not have to know this.
- Every version in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` has `# read YYYY-MM-DD from <url>` beside it. A pin with no date and URL is a pin from memory; the reviewer sends it back.
- Use `kotlinx.coroutines` for every concurrent thing. Do not use `Thread`, `synchronized`, `CountDownLatch`, `AtomicReference`, or `Thread.sleep`.
- A module may keep a raw `Thread`, a lock, or `Thread.sleep` where a coroutines primitive cannot reproduce something the module genuinely needs: a dedicated OS thread's priority, a timed or reentrant lock that must not throw where the design records a failure and returns, or a cancellation path that depends on being interrupt-driven rather than exception-driven. State the specific reason next to the site; "this is simpler" and "this is how it was written" are not reasons. A module does not get this by default: it argues each site, as the audio module's card does.
- A test waits on a signal. A test never waits on a clock.
- One module per work order. One work order per PR.
- When a build error names a library, read the first error line before you change anything. The first line is the cause.
